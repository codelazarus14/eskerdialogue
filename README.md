### Esker Dialogue Addition

A little dialogue addition for the most underserved (imo) traveller in Outer Wilds.

Their dialogue can be edited by replacing the `eskertext.json` file in the mod's installation directory 
(`../OWML/Mods/codelazarus14.EskerDialogueAddition/`) but it requires the contents of a dialogue XML. 
For reference, I supplied the default addition's XML to be edited somewhere more *visually appealing* 
before copying it into the `"Text":` field of the JSON.

Nor does this mod really make use of the full scope of OWML - I just wanted to learn the basics and spend some more time with an old friend.
