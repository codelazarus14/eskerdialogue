### Esker Dialogue Addition

A little dialogue addition for the most underserved (imo) traveller in Outer Wilds.

Their dialogue can be edited by replacing the `eskertext.json` file in the mod's installation directory 
(`../OWML/Mods/codelazarus14.EskerDialogueAddition/`) but it requires the contents of a dialogue XML. 
For reference, I supplied the original XML to edit somewhere more visually appealing before removing
line breaks and copying it into the `"Text":` field of the JSON.

Nor does this mod really make use of the full scope of OWML - I just wanted to learn and write a little dialogue for an old friend.
